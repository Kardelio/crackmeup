###NOTE: crackmeup is now deprecated and has now transmogrified into a twitter bot and a joke API. Say hi to the bot at [@crackmeupbro](https://twitter.com/crackmupbro) and find the API at [crackmeup-api.herokuapp.com](crackmeup-api.herokuapp.com) with the source code at [crackmeup-api](https://github.com/bholagabbar/crackmeup-api)

#####The source code for the bot has not been made public due to the twitter API keys being used. Please contact me if you wish to access the same.
